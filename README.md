# Community Library Network

3rd Year Team Project:

A network of physical community libraries where users can borrow or books or leave new books. Users require an account, and can interact with the kiosk through the touchscreen, or by connecting to it through Bluetooth with the provided phone app. Library locations are tracked and displayed on a map online and in the app for users to visit.
